  <h1 ><u>Online Examination System</u></h1>
  <h2 style="color:red"><u>Project Overview</u></h2>
  <p>Now-a-days,<a href="https://www.merittrac.com/guides/how-online-examination-works" target="_blank"> <b>Online Examination System</b></a> has become popular for competitive examinations because of its unique features such as auto-evaluation, speed and accuracy.   Moreover, it also helps environments by reducing the use of paper. In such a system, students are asked to select answers from multiple options given for a single question. Likewise, there are several questions which appear in the students’ systems. The questions and multiple options are saved in a database along with desired answers. Typically, a student can edit an answer after saving it, however, editing cannot be done after submitting the answer. Another user is also there – administrator. The administrator can create, modify and delete questions and accordingly, the question is updated in the system.</p></br>
